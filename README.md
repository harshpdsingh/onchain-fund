## üåà About

Create your own pension fund linked to any ERC-20 token. This app allows you to deposit, withdraw, invest, and pass on your funds to another person if no proof of life is provided within three years.

Features:

ERC-20 Compatibility: The contract supports any ERC-20 token (USDC is used in this demo). 
Flexible Withdrawals: The account holder can withdraw funds anytime. 
Proof of Life: Regular interactions with the contract ensure continued access and can be manually updated.

The project was built using Scaffold-ETH 2 as the foundation for both the frontend and smart contracts. A security layer was added with OpenZeppelin, implementing ReentrancyGuard, Ownable, and Pausable functions. Additionally, a frame was created to interact directly with the smart contract in Farcaster, along with an XMTP bot to enable chat-based communication.

The smart contract is deployed across multiple blockchains, offering users broad interoperability.
